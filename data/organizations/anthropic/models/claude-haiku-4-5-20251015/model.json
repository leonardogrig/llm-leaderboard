  "description": "Claude Haiku 4.5 is Anthropic's fastest, most cost-efficient model, matching Sonnet 4's performance on coding, computer use, and agent tasks. It offers similar performance to Sonnet 4 at one-third the cost and more than twice the speed, making it ideal for high-volume, latency-sensitive applications and multi-agent orchestration.",
